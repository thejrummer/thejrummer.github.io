Howdy! My name is Jarrett Thompson, I'm a freelance drummer/percussionist, composer, graphic designer, painter, sound engineer, and maker. I currently live in Statesboro, Georgia with my wife Loren and our two pups. In 2019 I graduated from Georgia Southern University with a Bachelor's of Music in Percussion Performance. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's of Music in Music Technology.
