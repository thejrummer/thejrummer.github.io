ABSTRACT:

thwacK is an application created with Max/MSP that utilizes the drumset as a controller

predetermined samples of audio in various ways. thwacK is created to be used in improvisational
contexts. This paper details and evaluates the overall design, motivation, and musical
implementation of thwacK, as well as situate thwacK in the field of current systems for creating
electronic music with drumset-oriented control interfaces.
